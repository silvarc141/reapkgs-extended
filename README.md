# reapkgs-extended

Nix flake generated using [reapkgs](https://github.com/silvarc141/reapkgs) for an arbitrary list of [ReaPack](https://reapack.com) repos, that are not in the "known" list.  

If you want a repo to be included, make a PR.

Since regeneration is automated, the flake provides no vetting of packages.
